PLG_SYSTEM_PHPVERSIONCHECK="System - PHP Version Check"
PLG_SYSTEM_PHPVERSIONCHECK_SECURITY_ONLY="Your PHP version, %1$s, is only receiving security fixes at this time from the PHP project. This means your PHP version will soon no longer be supported. We recommend planning to upgrade to a newer PHP version before it reaches end of support on %2$s. Joomla will be faster and more secure if you upgrade to a newer PHP version (PHP 7.x is recommended). Please contact your host for upgrade instructions."
PLG_SYSTEM_PHPVERSIONCHECK_UNSUPPORTED="Your PHP version, %1$s, is no longer supported by the PHP project. Support for this version of PHP ended on %2$s. Joomla will be faster and more secure if you upgrade to a newer PHP version (PHP 7.x is recommended). Contact your host - they can usually do this for you very easily."
PLG_SYSTEM_PHPVERSIONCHECK_XML_DESCRIPTION="Checks the support status of your installation's PHP version and raises a warning if not fully supported."

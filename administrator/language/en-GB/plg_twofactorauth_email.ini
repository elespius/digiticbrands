PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_EMAIL_CONFIG_TIMESTEP_DESC="A new code is generated every this many minutes. Do note that a generated code is valid for at least this much time and at most twice as much time. The higher this period is the more likely it is for the code to be brute forced, therefore the least secure your site is. A period of 2 minutes is a good trade-off between usability and security."

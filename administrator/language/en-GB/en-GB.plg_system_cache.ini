PLG_CACHE_FIELD_BROWSERCACHE_DESC="Instruct user's browser to store pages into its cache, <br/><br/>
- thus browser will not re-request and re-download the page on next user visit to the -same- URL, thus speeding up user's experience. <br/><br/>
Note: usually you would not enable this, if you are allowing users to login in the frontend, because it will not work properly with most components"

PLG_CACHE_FIELD_EXCLUDE_DESC="Specify which URLs you want to exclude from caching, each on a separate line. Regular expressions are supported, eg. <br /><strong>about\-[a-z]+</strong> - will exclude all URLs that contain 'about-', for example 'about-us', 'about-me', 'about-joomla' etc.<br /><strong>\/component\/users\/</strong> - will exclude all URLs that contain /component/users/"

PLG_CACHE_XML_DESCRIPTION="Provides page caching. <br/> <br/>This will not recreate page HTML <br/>
- either <b>until</b> the cache expires (set expire time in global configuration) <br/>
- or <b>until</b> you clear the cache <br/><br/>
<b>Note</b>: This is not to be confused with <b>conservative / progressive</b> caching (enable it in Global configuration) <br/> which works indepedent of this plugin and is a more proper choice if you want your changes to appear immediately to the frontend without waiting for cache time to expire"
PLG_SYSTEM_CACHE="System - Page Cache"

PLG_CACHE_FIELD_BROWSERCACHE_DESC="Instruct user's browser to store pages into its cache, <br/><br/>
- thus browser will not re-request and re-download the page on next user visit to the -same- URL, thus speeding up user's experience. <br/><br/>
Note: usually you would not enable this, if you are allowing users to login in the frontend, because it will not work properly with most components"

PLG_CACHE_FIELD_BROWSERCACHE_LABEL="Use Browser Caching"
PLG_CACHE_FIELD_EXCLUDE_DESC="Specify which URLs you want to exclude from caching, each on a separate line. Regular expressions are supported, eg. <br /><strong>about\-[a-z]+</strong> - will exclude all URLs that contain 'about-', for example 'about-us', 'about-me', 'about-joomla' etc.<br /><strong>\/component\/users\/</strong> - will exclude all URLs that contain /component/users/"
PLG_CACHE_FIELD_EXCLUDE_LABEL="Exclude URLs"
PLG_CACHE_FIELD_EXCLUDE_MENU_ITEMS_DESC="Select which menu items you want to exclude from caching."

PLG_CACHE_FIELD_LIFETIME_DESC="Page cache lifetime in minutes."
PLG_CACHE_FIELD_LIFETIME_LABEL="Cache Lifetime"

PLG_CACHE_XML_DESCRIPTION="Enables page caching. <br/> <br/>This will not recreate page HTML <br/>
- either <b>until</b> the cache expires (set expire time in global configuration) <br/>
- or <b>until</b> you clear the cache <br/><br/>
Thus this plugin is a trade off:<br/>
- it achieves <b>a little lower</b> CPU loads for your server compared to other type of caching <b>(*) see below</b><br/>
<b>at the expense of pages appearing wrongly until cache expires</b>
<br/>
<hr/>
<b>Note</b>: (*) This is not to be confused with <b>conservative / progressive</b> caching (enable it in Global configuration) <br/>
<b>Conservative / progressive</b> caching  <br/>
- works indepedent of this plugin <br/>
- HTML of views / modules is updated when settings / content are changed, because the corresponding part of the cache is cleared<br/><br/>
Thus making it the the proper choice if you want your changes to appear immediately to the frontend without waiting for cache time to expire"
PLG_SYSTEM_CACHE="System - Page Cache"

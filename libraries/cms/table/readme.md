The JTableCms class is just a very simplified version of JTable. 

In order for MVSC to work, all of the supporting classes (Model, View, Table) need to throw exceptions when something goes wrong.

Since the point here is to demonstrate how MVSC works, I didn't attempt to implement all the functionality available in the JTable package.

There is still a lot of work that needs to be done here.
